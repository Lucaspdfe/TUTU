# TUTU

TUTU is my little project for 2025. I have school so, there will be pauses in development. I will try to keep it updated as much as possible (I'm a 11 year old for gods sake).

## Why do this?

I'll be honest, I don't know. Just got bored of web and game development.

## What are your plans?

Make a simple OS with (at least) a basic shell with FAT16 support (the OS is supposed to work on a single floppy disk). Maybe adding some extra things like a basic text editor and even my own type of executable file, called ".TUE" (TUTU Executable).

## Q&A

- How do I test it? All instructions are in doc/BUILD.md. On official releases, you can download the .img file.
- Where can i find documentation? Documentation is available in the doc/ directory.
- Where did you get the name idea? I got that idea from the popular game "Deltarune", in which the character Jackenstein say "YOUR TUTU". It's funny.
- How do I contribute? Sorry, this is a solo project, but if you find any bugs, you can open an issue on GitHub and i'll try to fix it as soon as possible.
